what's up buttercup?

cock boner.

Gonna update this post as I work more.

This blog is a a dev diary. 

So eventually maps are gonna get too big for ram, so I need some way to save and load parts of the map to disk as the player moves around.

So far I've been generating the map from the osm data as the player moves around, but this is quite limiting; even using a worker thread, and a very good cpu, I'm limited by how much calculation I can do if that player wants to explore at a certain speed. With more calculation time, I can generate a better map.

Solution to this is to pre-process any computationally intensive parts of the map gen beforehand, saving the results of each chunk to file, and loading these results in as necessary, rather than having to do all the calcs on the fly during runtime. 

Many aspects of the map gen will be random; ie the same map data can produce different maps each generation, however so far all the really slow stuff doesn't have any randomness to it, so pre-processing this is fine.

One such slow thing to pre-process is water pixels. The last few days I've been writing functions that look at the various water ways and relations in the data and figure out which pixels are water. There are many nuances and complexities to this that I don't want to get too deep into.

The map data has 3 basic data structures; Nodes, Ways, & Relations. Until now, I haven't done anything with relations, just nodes and ways, but I have to look at relations now to get the water pixels right. Here's some pictures just to give you an idea of a few of the weird cases I have to deal with:

What adds to the complexities, is some of these relations are huge; covering entire continents, so often maps will be missing parts of those large relations, so I have to figure out how to deal with all those cases too.
